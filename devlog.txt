devlog entry summarizing external readme review:

The install/launch instructions did their job but it could've been a lot more clear and specific- Our reviewer had some difficulty due to occassionally missing a step (like cd-ing into the folder/directory)-

Other groups were much more thorough with their readme and install/launch instructions- Most had much more specific intructions that consisted of listed and ordered information on how to install or launch- Some groups had commands in code blocks, something that would've made the installation/launch process much more convienent- There were a few groups who gave more general instructions that could be applied to other repositories and not limited to this specific project-
